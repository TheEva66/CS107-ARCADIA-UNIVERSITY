        Essay â€“ El Nino by Random Student<br />
        <hr>
 El Nino is spanish. It is the spanish word for child. Like all things Spanish,
 it is dangerous. It kills people and burns down trees. This child is more than
 a child. It really isn't a child at all. It is a storm. A deadly storm that
 kills people and burns down trees.
 Warm water usually builds up around Australia. But not anymore with El Nino.
 El Nino moves the warm water from Australia to somewhere else, namely to other
 places. Where are these other places? These are places that also have water,
 but water that is usually not as warm as the warm water El Nino moves to these
 said other places. These other places are to the east. Of the water.
 In Peru, they have many names for many things. One of the things they have
 names for is for people who go fishing, go fishing to make a living. If we had a
 word for this kind of people that word would be "fisherman". But we don't. In Peru,
 they have different names for things than we do in America. They call that kind of
 people "pescadores". That's Spanish. That's what they speak in Peru. When El Nino
 comes, these "pescadores" can't catch any fish. El Nino is caused when the Peruvian
 gods get angry. They have been angry for millions of years and have made El Nino
 for millions of years. Many many moons ago, the Peruvians committed human sacrifice
 to satiate their gods and end the flood that was caused by El Nino. In today's modern
 dog-eat-dog work-a-day world of scientists, diplomats, McSalad Shakers, and George
 Bush Jr., we no longer have access to such solutions. We are too proud. We will not
 commit human sacrifices. We refuse to satiate the Peruvian gods. Thus, they remain
 Angry and keep killing us and burning down our trees with El Nino.
 Instead of satiating the gods, many of these "scientists" have tried to control El Nino
 with "science". They put up expensive fish-attracting-buoys that run on flashlight
 batteries. Imagine, fighting the power of the gods with flashlight batteries! Needless
 to say, this didn't work and everyone died.
